# Certificate Storage on Celo Blockchain

This project is designed to store certificates securely on the Celo blockchain. It serves as a safety measure in case of fire accidents or robberies, ensuring that important documents are preserved and accessible even in such unfortunate events. The project utilizes various technologies including Celo Contract Kit, React, Solidity, Hardhat, and Bootstrap.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to follow the installation steps outlined below:

1. Install a wallet:
   - CeloExtensionWallet: Visit the Celo Extension Wallet website (https://celowallet.app) and follow the instructions to install the wallet extension for your browser.
   - MetamaskExtensionWallet: Visit the Metamask website (https://metamask.io) and install the Metamask extension for your browser.

2. Create a wallet:
   - Once the wallet extension is installed, follow the wallet provider's instructions to create a new wallet. Make sure to securely store your wallet's seed phrase or private key.

3. Obtain testnet tokens:
   - Visit the Celo developers' faucet website (https://celo.org/developers/faucet) and follow the instructions to request testnet tokens for the Alfajores testnet. These tokens are necessary for interacting with the Celo blockchain.

4. Switch to the Alfajores testnet:
   - In the CeloExtensionWallet, switch your network to the Alfajores testnet. This ensures that you are connected to the appropriate blockchain network to interact with the certificate storage application.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation steps, you can start using the certificate storage application. Follow the steps below to store your certificates on the Celo blockchain:

1. Open the certificate storage application.
   - Ensure that your wallet extension (CeloExtensionWallet or MetamaskExtensionWallet) is active and connected to the Alfajores testnet.

2. Connect your wallet.
   - On the certificate storage application, click on the "Connect Wallet" button. This will prompt your wallet extension to authorize the connection.

3. Upload your certificate.
   - Click on the "Upload Certificate" button or similar functionality provided by the application to upload your certificate file. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the upload process.

4. Confirm and store the certificate on the blockchain.
   - Review the details of the certificate you are about to store, and confirm the transaction through your wallet extension. This transaction will store the certificate securely on the Celo blockchain.

5. Access and verify stored certificates.
   - Use the appropriate functionality provided by the application to access and verify your stored certificates whenever needed. The application should offer features like searching, sorting, and displaying certificate details.

Remember to keep your wallet's seed phrase or private key secure at all times. Losing access to your wallet may result in the loss of your certificates stored on the Celo blockchain.
